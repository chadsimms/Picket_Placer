# Picket_Placer

This is designed to calculate the spacing to place pickets on a fence.  Most of the math is implemented with rounding to the nearest 1/16" when placing the pickets.  

However, implementation to accept fractions as inputs is needed and then porting to mobile would be better.  Simple GUI would be fantastic.
